# OpenPPL Implementation Roadmap for GeckoBot

This document outlines the plan for implementing the full range of OpenPPL concepts in the GeckoBot poker bot.

## Priority Order

1. **Advanced Betting Action Symbols** - Fundamental for understanding the betting context
2. **History Symbols** - Essential for multi-street decision making
3. **Board Texture Analysis** - Critical for hand strength evaluation
4. **Advanced Hand Strength Evaluation** - Improves decision quality
5. **Outs Calculation** - Better drawing hand decisions
6. **Advanced Position Symbols** - More nuanced positional play
7. **Stack-to-Pot Ratio (SPR) Based Decisions** - Improved bet sizing
8. **Opponent Modeling** - Adaptability to different opponents
9. **Tournament-Specific Logic** - For tournament play
10. **Verbosity and Debugging** - For development and tuning

## Implementation Notes

Each implementation will follow this process:
1. Research the specific OpenPPL concept in the reference files
2. Design the implementation approach
3. Implement the feature
4. Write tests
5. Integrate with existing code
6. Document the implementation
