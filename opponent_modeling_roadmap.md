# Opponent Modeling Implementation Roadmap

This roadmap outlines the steps to implement a comprehensive opponent modeling system for the GeckoBot poker bot. While OpenPPL has limited built-in support for opponent modeling, we'll extend it with additional features while maintaining compatibility with the OpenPPL framework.

## Phase 1: OpenPPL Opponent Symbols

### 1.1 Basic Opponent Counting
- [ ] Implement OpenPPL opponent counting symbols (OpponentsLeft, OpponentsAtTable, etc.)
- [ ] Implement OpenPPL opponent position symbols (OpponentsOnFlop, OpponentsOnTurn, etc.)
- [ ] Implement OpenPPL opponent stack symbols (OpponentsWithLowerStack, etc.)

### 1.2 Action Tracking
- [ ] Track opponents' actions by street (preflop, flop, turn, river)
- [ ] Track opponents' actions by position (early, middle, late)
- [ ] Track opponents' betting patterns (check-raise, continuation bet, etc.)

### 1.3 Basic Integration
- [ ] Add opponent tracking to TableState class
- [ ] Update opponent tracking after each action
- [ ] Implement basic decision adjustments based on opponent counts

## Phase 2: Extended Opponent Statistics

### 2.1 Core Poker Statistics
- [ ] Implement VPIP (Voluntarily Put Money In Pot) tracking
- [ ] Implement PFR (Preflop Raise) tracking
- [ ] Implement AF (Aggression Factor) tracking
- [ ] Implement WTSD (Went To Showdown) tracking
- [ ] Create methods to access these statistics for decision making

### 2.2 Street-Specific Statistics
- [ ] Track flop continuation bet frequency
- [ ] Track turn double-barrel frequency
- [ ] Track river triple-barrel frequency
- [ ] Track check-raise frequency by street
- [ ] Implement fold-to-continuation-bet tracking

### 2.3 Position-Based Statistics
- [ ] Track statistics by position (early, middle, late, blinds)
- [ ] Implement position-aware decision making
- [ ] Track blind defense and steal frequencies
- [ ] Track button aggression and 3-bet frequencies

## Phase 3: Opponent Exploitation

### 3.1 Player Type Classification
- [ ] Implement player type classification (tight-passive, loose-aggressive, etc.)
- [ ] Create methods to update player type based on observed statistics
- [ ] Implement methods to get current player type
- [ ] Develop a classification system that works with limited data

### 3.2 Exploitative Adjustments
- [ ] Implement adjustments against tight players (bluff more, value bet thinner)
- [ ] Implement adjustments against loose players (value bet wider, bluff less)
- [ ] Implement adjustments against aggressive players (trap more, 3-bet lighter)
- [ ] Implement adjustments against passive players (bet for value more often)
- [ ] Create a framework for dynamic strategy adjustment

### 3.3 Advanced Exploitation
- [ ] Calculate fold equity against different opponent types
- [ ] Implement bluff frequency adjustments based on opponent tendencies
- [ ] Implement value betting adjustments based on opponent tendencies
- [ ] Calculate optimal bet sizing against different opponent types
- [ ] Implement dynamic range adjustment based on opponent tendencies

### 3.4 Multi-Player Table Dynamics
- [ ] Implement table image tracking
- [ ] Adjust strategy based on overall table dynamics
- [ ] Implement multi-way pot adjustments based on opponent types
- [ ] Develop position-based strategy adjustments for different table types

## Phase 4: Integration and Optimization

### 4.1 Full Integration
- [ ] Integrate opponent modeling with all decision points in GeckoBot
- [ ] Update opponent models across multiple hands
- [ ] Implement persistence of opponent models between sessions
- [ ] Create a unified API for accessing opponent data

### 4.2 Performance Optimization
- [ ] Optimize memory usage for opponent modeling
- [ ] Optimize CPU usage for real-time decision making
- [ ] Implement efficient data structures for opponent modeling
- [ ] Ensure minimal impact on overall bot performance

### 4.3 Testing and Validation
- [ ] Create test cases for opponent modeling
- [ ] Validate opponent modeling against known player types
- [ ] Measure performance improvements from opponent modeling
- [ ] Develop a framework for A/B testing different opponent models

## Phase 5: Advanced Features

### 5.1 Hand Range Modeling
- [ ] Implement hand range estimation for opponents
- [ ] Update hand ranges based on observed actions
- [ ] Calculate equity against estimated hand ranges
- [ ] Adjust strategy based on opponent's likely holdings

### 5.2 Pattern Recognition
- [ ] Implement pattern recognition for betting patterns
- [ ] Detect and exploit sizing tells (min-bets, pot-sized bets, etc.)
- [ ] Identify and exploit frequency-based patterns
- [ ] Develop a system to detect changes in opponent strategy

### 5.3 Fold Equity Calculations
- [ ] Implement accurate fold equity calculations
- [ ] Adjust bluffing frequency based on fold equity
- [ ] Calculate expected value of bluffs against different opponents
- [ ] Develop a dynamic bluffing strategy based on fold equity

### 5.4 Machine Learning Integration
- [ ] Implement basic machine learning for opponent modeling
- [ ] Train models on historical hand data
- [ ] Continuously update models based on new observations
- [ ] Develop a hybrid approach combining rule-based and ML-based modeling
