# OpenPPL Implementation Progress - History Symbols

## Overview

We have successfully implemented the second major component of the OpenPPL framework: History Symbols. This implementation builds on our previous work with Advanced Betting Action Symbols and provides the GeckoBot with a comprehensive understanding of the action history throughout a hand.

## Implemented Features

### 1. Action History Tracking

- **Street-by-Street History**: Detailed tracking of all actions on each street (preflop, flop, turn, river)
- **Bot's Last Actions**: Tracking of the bot's most recent actions overall and by street
- **Opponent's Last Actions**: Tracking of opponents' most recent actions
- **Action Sequences**: Complete history of action sequences for each street

### 2. Action Count Tracking

- **Raises by Street**: Counting the number of raises on each street
- **Calls by Street**: Counting the number of calls on each street
- **Checks by Street**: Counting the number of checks on each street
- **Boolean Indicators**: Easy-to-use boolean methods to check if there were raises on a particular street

### 3. Stack Size Tracking

- **Starting Stack Size**: Tracking of the bot's starting stack size
- **Opponent Stack Sizes**: Tracking of minimum and maximum opponent stack sizes
- **Missing Blinds**: Detection of missing small blinds

### 4. OpenPPL Symbol Implementation

Implemented the following OpenPPL history symbols:
- `get_bots_last_action`
- `get_bots_last_preflop_action`
- `get_bots_last_flop_action`
- `get_bots_last_turn_action`
- `get_bots_last_river_action`
- `get_opponents_last_action`
- `get_bets`
- `get_calls`
- `get_checks`
- `get_raises`
- `get_number_of_raises_before_flop`
- `get_number_of_raises_on_flop`
- `get_number_of_raises_on_turn`
- `get_number_of_raises_on_river`
- `has_raises_before_flop`
- `has_raises_on_flop`
- `has_raises_on_turn`
- `has_raises_on_river`
- `get_max_opponent_stack_size`
- `get_min_opponent_stack_size`
- `is_missing_small_blind`
- `get_starting_stack_size`
- `get_preflop_action_history`
- `get_flop_action_history`
- `get_turn_action_history`
- `get_river_action_history`

## Integration with GeckoBot

The history symbols have been integrated with the GeckoBot in the following ways:

1. **TableState Integration**: The `TableState` class now maintains a `HistorySymbols` instance and updates it with every action.

2. **Decision-Making Updates**: The GeckoBot's decision-making methods have been updated to use the history symbols:
   - Preflop decisions now have access to preflop action history
   - Flop decisions now have access to preflop and flop action history
   - Turn decisions now have access to preflop, flop, and turn action history
   - River decisions now have access to the complete action history

3. **Action Recording**: The `record_action` method in the `TableState` class now updates both the betting action symbols and the history symbols.

## Testing

We've created comprehensive tests to verify the implementation:

1. **Unit Tests**: The `test_history_symbols.py` file contains unit tests for the `HistorySymbols` class.

2. **Integration Tests**: The `test_history_symbols_integration.py` file tests the integration of the history symbols with the `TableState` class.

## Next Steps

With the History Symbols implemented, we can now move on to the next item in our roadmap:

### 3. Board Texture Analysis
- [ ] Connectedness
- [ ] Suitedness
- [ ] Paired Boards
- [ ] Texture Changes
- [ ] Draw Possibilities
- [ ] Board Danger Level

This will further enhance the bot's ability to make decisions based on the texture of the board.
