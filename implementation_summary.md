# OpenPPL Implementation Progress - Advanced Betting Action Symbols

## Overview

We have successfully implemented the first major component of the OpenPPL framework: Advanced Betting Action Symbols. This implementation provides the GeckoBot with a much more sophisticated understanding of betting patterns and contexts, which will significantly improve its decision-making capabilities.

## Implemented Features

### 1. Betting Action Tracking

- **Action Recording**: Comprehensive tracking of all actions by all players across all streets
- **Street Transitions**: Proper handling of transitions between betting streets
- **Action History**: Detailed history of actions for analysis and decision-making

### 2. Betting Pattern Detection

- **Continuation Bet Detection**: Recognizes when a player who raised preflop bets on the flop
- **Check-Raise Detection**: Identifies when a player checks and then raises after someone else bets
- **3-Bet/4-Bet Logic**: Tracks raise sequences to identify 3-bet and 4-bet situations
- **Donk Betting Detection**: Recognizes when an out-of-position player bets into the previous street's aggressor
- **Probe Bet Detection**: Identifies when an in-position player bets after a check
- **Float Bet Detection**: Recognizes when a player calls on one street and bets on the next

### 3. OpenPPL Symbol Implementation

Implemented the following OpenPPL symbols:
- `bot_is_last_raiser`
- `bot_raised_before_flop`
- `bot_raised_on_flop`
- `bot_raised_on_turn`
- `bot_raised_on_river`
- `bot_called_before_flop`
- `bot_called_on_flop`
- `bot_called_on_turn`
- `bot_called_on_river`
- `bot_checked_preflop`
- `bot_checked_on_flop`
- `bot_checked_on_turn`
- `bot_checked_on_river`
- `bots_actions_on_this_round`
- `no_betting_on_flop`
- `no_betting_on_turn`
- `raises_since_last_play`
- `calls_since_last_play`
- `is_continuation_bet`
- `is_check_raise`
- `is_three_bet`
- `is_four_bet`
- `is_donk_bet`
- `is_probe_bet`
- `is_float_bet`

## Integration with GeckoBot

The betting action symbols have been integrated with the GeckoBot in the following ways:

1. **TableState Integration**: The `TableState` class now maintains a `BettingActionSymbols` instance and updates it with every action.

2. **Decision-Making Updates**: The GeckoBot's decision-making methods have been updated to use the betting action symbols:
   - `_facing_raise` now uses `raises_since_last_play`
   - `_multiple_raisers` now uses a more accurate count of raises
   - `_facing_donk_bet` now uses `is_donk_bet`
   - `_facing_cbet` now uses `is_continuation_bet`

3. **Action Recording**: The `GameRunner` class now records all actions in the betting action symbols tracker.

## Testing

We've created comprehensive tests to verify the implementation:

1. **Unit Tests**: The `test_betting_action_symbols.py` file contains unit tests for the `BettingActionSymbols` class.

2. **Integration Tests**: The `test_betting_symbols_integration.py` file tests the integration of the betting action symbols with the `TableState` class.

## Next Steps

With the Advanced Betting Action Symbols implemented, we can now move on to the next item in our roadmap:

### 2. History Symbols
- [ ] BotsLastAction
- [ ] BotsLastPreflopAction
- [ ] BotsLastFlopAction
- [ ] BotsLastTurnAction
- [ ] OpponentsLastAction
- [ ] PreflopActionHistory

This will further enhance the bot's ability to make decisions based on the history of the hand.
